# StoryForest


StoryForest is a collaborative storytelling web-app built in Ruby on Rails.

Users can create StoryTrees which have a title and a trunk. The trunk is the opening paragraph (up to 700 characters). Once a StoryTree is created, users can choose to either make a new branch or add to the current branch (700 character max). Once a branch has been added to a trunk the trunk cannot be deleted or edited. Same goes for branches. If a branch has a sub-branch it cannot be edited nor deleted.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running but I haven't gotten that far yet.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
